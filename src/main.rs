//! This is a complete, although basic, example of a (custom) USB Vendor
//! Device, developed to be run on the Raspberry Pi Pico (RP2040).
//!
//! It has a C equivalent, using the Pico SDK, and TinyUSB, and can be found
//! [here](https://github.com/piersfinlayson/tinyusb-vendor-example)
//!
//! With probe.rs installed and configured, and a Debug Probe connected and
//! attached to the Pico, you can deploy this example with:
//!
//! ```bash
//! cargo run --release
//! ```
//!
//! See `README.md` for more information.

//
// CriticalSectionRawMutex is required here, as both cores access WATCHDOG.
// This will create a critical_section to ensure that the mutex is accessed
// safely.

// TODO - As we have multiple tasks running concurrently, we should probably
// implement a wrapper in order to ensure that one running runner (and other
// failed runners) don't keep the device alive.
